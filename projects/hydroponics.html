                    A successful attempt at growing lettuce and bok choy using hydroponics, a biotechnology that completely removes the dirt aspect of plant growth and replacing it with a nutrient mixture instead.

                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    In our individuals and societies course in grade 9, we had a unit centered around Earth Day – a celebrated day to demonstrate support for environmental protection. We were told to find a topic that we were interested about, which I chose hydroponics, a technology that I thought was cool and was absolutely game-changing if demonstrated well. <br><br>

                    I first started this project by doing research and doing initial designs for the shelf. My end goal for this project is to create a three-layer Hydroponics shelf, which could house about 100 plants/vegetables. So, I did some initial sketches, then went on designing in CAD software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After some refining and planning, I decided to make only ONE of the three layers of the shelf in the time being. Three layers were a little unrealistic for the time we had for the project, and I had to get moving quick. The rest will be coming soon later this year I hope™<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Creating</h3>
                <p>
                    Building time! I bought all the materials I needed off of the internet, costing only about 40 dollars (300 RMB)<br><br>

                    Using the school's Design lab and resources, I spent two days after school putting the shelf together, as planned. A lot is skipped here because most of it is repetitive and boring...
                </p>

                <p>
                    Oh yes! It's finished. And what is on the table there that look like little plants? Seedlings that I started about two weeks ago because of early planning that I've been hiding :D.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h3>Planting & Growing</h3>
                <p>
                    Growing a vegetable with hydroponics takes two "large" steps. First, we need to start seedlings, which is the process of making the seeds sprout into a small leafs, then moving them into the hydroponics system after. The seedlings are started in small sponges so the roots can have good access to water.

                <p>
                    (the mini seedlings are so cute awwwww)<br><br>

                    Then, the sponge that the plants are growing in can be taken apart and moved into the system :D Growing in the hydroponics system requires something more to make the plants live – plant nutrients (no need to go into specifics, but it's chemicals that have similar properties to dirt)<br><br>

                    I'm going to put more pictures here as the growing process is relatively the same from day1 to harvesting the plants.

                    (above: day 23/35)<br><br>
                    And then all the way until the last photo I took until the lettuce was eaten...

                    Sadly for the first attempt, we had to go online due to covid restrictions right after the exhibition, which left me with no time to go and harvest the product :( <br><br>

                    I will continue to develop this project into what the ambitions were at the start later on, probably in G10 :D<br><br>

                    To be continued...<br><br><br><br><br><br>
